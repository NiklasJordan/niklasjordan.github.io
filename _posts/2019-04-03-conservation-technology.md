<p class="highlight-box topo">
  <em>This is not a finished blog <g class="gr_ gr_6 gr-alert gr_gramm gr_inline_cards gr_disable_anim_appear Grammar multiReplace" id="6" data-gr-id="6">posts</g>, it&#8217;s more or less a growing collection about all stuff around conservation technology.</em>
</p>

I have a <g class="gr_ gr\_4 gr-alert gr\_spell gr\_inline\_cards gr\_run\_anim ContextualSpelling ins-del multiReplace" id="4" data-gr-id="4">huuuge</g> note file on my digital desk named _conservation-tech.md_. It&#8217;s a 500 lines huge list of projects, people and resources about the wide topic of using technology for open research and conservation I&#8217;ve collected over the years and ideas I had to get started in this.

I had already talked to a lot of people about this topic and again and again I wanted to refer to some content in my notes. This was followed by some wild e-mails or Twitter messages. From that came the idea of this blog post and its two goals:

  1. I want you to benefit from my research and not have to do the same work searching for resources and/or projects that I&#8217;ve already done, and
  2. I would like to have a divisible, referencable and searchable list in order to be able to access this list faster and easier myself.

## What is open technology and how can you use it for exploration and conservation?

The short: Open technology in exploration and conservation mean to me, using technology to improve and better understand our natural environment and creating things that will have a positive impact <g class="gr_ gr\_59 gr-alert gr\_gramm gr\_inline\_cards gr\_run\_anim Grammar multiReplace" id="59" data-gr-id="59">to</g> our nature. _Openness_ is a core value:

  * **Open Source:** The solutions we will build should be open to everyone to rebuild this and use it for their own case.
  * **Open for everyone:** This is not limited for scientists, it is also for citizens and foundations, nerds who just want to explore stuff, environmentalists and everyone else.

Open technology in this case is not limited to citizen science, but often there are overlaps between both topics.

A longer explanation of conservation technology, is [written by Shah Selbe on Conservify](http://conservify.org/open-conservation-what-is-it/).

## Resources

I seperate the resources in three audiences:

  * **Beginner:** People, who have no experience in technology or science.
  * **Scientists<g class="gr_ gr\_363 gr-alert gr\_gramm gr\_inline\_cards gr\_run\_anim Punctuation only-del replaceWithoutSep" id="363" data-gr-id="363">*:</g>** People, who would say about <g class="gr_ gr\_357 gr-alert gr\_spell gr\_inline\_cards gr\_disable\_anim_appear ContextualSpelling ins-del multiReplace" id="357" data-gr-id="357">thereselves</g> &#8220;I am a scientist&#8221; or have deep scientific knowledge in their topic, and mostly need knowledge in technology topics, how technology can help in research or where to start in technology.
  * **Technologists**: All people, who have deep knowledge in technology topics like, data, coding or hardware engineering, and mostly need knowledge in scientific stuff or need to know where to help or to start.

_*This does not include professional scientists only. It means also citizens who have deep knowldge in their topic they want to make research in._
