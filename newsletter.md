# Newsletter

Hereâ€™s the deal. I read loads of things about environmental and climate stuff, technology and nerd stuff, about our transforming world and cities and an ethical approach to challenge all these things.

Once a month, I send a tiny but brimming, personally written email of my best treasures. I guarantee that it will always be completely free and worth your time.

**What do you get?**

- monthly e-mail
- only selected articles
- roundup of the best people, environmental & technology stuff
- No hurry, just take a look at the latest issue.

*Your privacy is important, and your email is safe with me. You can unsubscribe at any time with just one click.*

You still don't want to leave me your e-mail address? No problem, of course you can also read every issue on (Substack)[https://niklasjordan.substack.com].
