# About me

## Basics
I am Niklas Jordan, a technologist and German-speaking European. I explore different ways to use technology for social and environmental good. Actually, I'm working in a digital agency in Northern Germany and help organisations to use technology with ethics, environmental impact and human rights in mind.

**10 years and counting…**
I've been using technology for good professionally since 2008. I've done this for different environmental organisations and refugee organisations, social enterprises, a few universities and many more.


## I am a…
### 1. technology guy.
Honest, sustainable and independent technology is essential to me. I believe that technology should be the property and control of the people who use it, and we who develop technology should do so ethically and responsibly.

I also speak and write regularly about the importance of sustainability, accessibility and responsibility in the technology and design industry.

Topics in tech I care about:
- help social and environmental good organisations to make the most of technology and increase their impact
- Civic and open science technology
- UX, usability and accessibility
- privacy and tech ethics
- Low-cost technology

### 2. science guy.
Since 2018 I have been studying Earth and Environmental Sciences part-time at the British Open University.
I am mainly interested in the following scientific fields:
- Earth system and climate science
- Natural disasters
- GIS & remote sensing
- Oceanography
- Open Science
- Climate-related urban planning

Most of what I do will happen between both personalities!

## Principles
I believe that technology can have a positive impact on the world. Tech can empower oppressed people, protect the environment, help people in emergencies and much more. Too often, however, it is used to exploit people and infiltrate human rights. This can lead to significant damage to people and the environment. I aim to promote the use of technology for good. Everything I do will follow the [Ethical Design Manifesto →](https://2017.ind.ie/ethical-design/), and I'm committed to the [hacker ethic →](https://www.ccc.de/en/hackerethik).

- people before technology
- simple solutions over technology masturbation
- solutions should be accessible, planet-friendly and respect human effort and rights

## Lastly...
When I’m not making the things above, you’ll find me cycling or exploring the nature.
